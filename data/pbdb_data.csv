(2018): In the original description the inclusion is reported to be in Baltic amber, but Prof. A. Rasnitsyn has examined the specimen and concluded it is copal. The surface of this specimen, as that of the fossil pyraloid Glendotricha olgae Kusnezov, 1941, show greater deterioration than the other amber specimens dealt with in the same paper by Kusnezov (1941) and deposited at the PIRAS. In addition, solubility tests were conducted on small, detached pieces of Glendotricha olgae. In less than an hour in 95% alcohol, these particles turned into an opaque jelly-like mass, a reaction typical to copal but which never occurs when alcohol is applied to real Baltic amber (a succinite). Copal is younger than amber, but a more precise age and origin of Electresia zalesskii are currently not known. Coordinates based on Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, as it seems possible that the material is East African copal.",gp_mid,39.34,-6.87,701

Essentially the entire floor of Barn Owl Cave is covered by some sort of sediment, ranging from mainly boulders on the talus slopes to various fine-grained sediments in low-lying areas. For example, the talus slopes in Rooms 1-3 are composed mainly of angular basaltic pebbles and boulders up to 1.2 m in diameter, whereas much of the floor of Room 3 is covered by loose, fine sediments (clays through sands).

As with most thick talus accumulations in caves on Floreana, these slopes have a dip of 30 ¬∞-35 ¬∞. The original basaltic floor is exposed in much of the northern two-thirds of Finch Cave. Essentially unfossiliferous, finegrained\r\nsediments (mainly clays and silts) occur in the low-lying sections of the North Room of Finch Cave. These sediments appear to be derived from soil that periodically washed into the cave via the roof collapse, for they are darker and better sorted than the fossil-bearing sediments excavated from the other three caves.",gp_mid,,,coordinates not computable using this model

Discovered during construction of the Hotel Bali Hai, the site straddles the boundary between Vaito' otia and Fa'ahia, two traditional land districts on Huahine (Sinoto 1988: Figure 1). The site, therefore, has been called by both names, depending on which side of the boundary a given excavation occurs. Thus the name Vaito' otia (site ScH1-1) was used by Sinoto and McCoy (1975) and Bellwood (1979: 310,324), while the name Fa'ahia (site ScH1-2) was used by Pigeot (1985, 1986). Both names were used by Emory (1979) and Sinoto (1979, 1983, 1988). Even though initial excavations were in the Vaito' otia district and later excavations were in Fa' ahia, less than 100 m separates the two excavated areas (Figure 4).

Rock shelves and scree slopes typify the east wall, and two small chambers end in soft clay sediment deposits. On the west wall, the boulder slope continues into the deepest point of the cave, 7 m below the entrance. A narrow passage at the rear (south) end of the cave continues upward to end at a small hole in the floor lacking sediment. On the outside, 3 m east of the entrance, a small indentation in the rock forms a dead-end passage containing clay sediments, and similar material continues back along the cave wall westward to the cave entrance.",gp_mid,44.48,-17.9,702
